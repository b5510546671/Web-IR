faraday follows in franklin's footsteps

following in the footsteps of ben franklin, michael faraday studied the nature of electricity. born on september 22, 1791, this
famous english physicist and chemist is best remembered for his understanding of electromagnetism. once faraday discovered that
electricity could be made by moving a magnet inside a wire coil, he was able to build the first electric motor. he later built the first
generator and transformer. he introduced several words that we still use today to discuss electricity: ion, electrode, cathode, and
anode. 

faraday is also remembered for his contributions to the study of chemistry. most noteworthy was his discovery of benzene, a
common carbon compound. later in life, faraday became professor of chemistry at the royal institution. he was a powerful speaker
and his lectures were popular. every year on christmas day, he presented his faraday lectures for children which were crowded
with interested listeners. to honor his accomplishments, a unit of electricity was named after him. the "farad" measures capacitance,
an amount of electrical charge. faraday lived his whole life in england, where he died on august 25, 1867.
